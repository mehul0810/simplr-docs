Simple and Intuitive knowledge base and documentation plugin for WordPress.

= Contribute to SimplrDocs =

This plugin is proudly open source (GPL license) and we're always looking for more contributors. Whether you know another language, can code like no one's business, or just have an idea, we would love your help and input.

Here's a few ways you can contribute to SimplrDocs:

* Star/fork/watch the [SimplrDocs GitHub repository](https://github.com/mehul0810/simplrdocs "Visit the SimplrDocs GitHub Repo") to learn more about what issues we're tackling and the project is developing. If you've never worked with Github before, learn about [pull requests here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and submit one for Sim, we'd love to give you our feedback.

* Translate SimplrDocs into your native language. The best place to do that is here on wordpress.org. Go to [https://translate.wordpress.org/](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/simplrdocs), then search for your language, click the "Plugins" tab, then search for "SimplrDocs". When you've submitted at least 95% of SimplrDocs's strings, the language moderators will review and approve your translations and then they will be available to all WordPress users for your native language.

* Join the [SimplrDocs Community Facebook group](https://). We chat about all things related to WordPress and SimplrDocs in general.


== Upgrade Notice ==

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.6 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of SimplrDocs, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "SimplrDocs" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
